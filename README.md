All commands will work on *nix without modification, use \ instead of / for Windows.

## Getting started

First you must build the MBM project using Maven

    cd <project root>
    mvn clean install

You will need to have MBM running in a separate process. From the console you can do the following

    cd <project root>/mbm
    java -jar target/mbm-develop-SNAPSHOT.jar server mbm.yml

Finally, you will need to start the Dojo Store
